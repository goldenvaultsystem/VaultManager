1. Product Purpose
      The Vault Manager software uses bank security key technology to protect your important data. It simplifies the process of using Windows native BitLocker to encrypt VHD files, adds bank-grade security key technology, helps users effectively eliminate the risk of data being stolen through brute-force attacks, and greatly enhances the security of user data.
      The vault VHD file generated by Vault Manager is natively supported by Windows and can be opened directly in any Windows environment without using Vault Manager.
      Vault Manager is primarily used in the following three application scenarios:
      1. Provides large-capacity hardware-encrypted vault files for local personal use. Security key hardware is required to access vault data. Users can create local personal-use hardware-encrypted secure storage container files;
      2. Provides medium-capacity public key encrypted vault files for cloud storage. Security key hardware is required to access vault data. Users can securely store important data on the internet without worrying about leaks;
      3. Provides small-capacity public key encrypted vault files for remote transmission, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of important data during transmission. Users can securely send important data to their remote endpoints over the internet.
