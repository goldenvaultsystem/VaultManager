                                                             User Agreement
1. Product Purpose
      Vault Manager adopts advanced public key encryption technology similar to modern e-commerce, providing public key encrypted vault file services. Used in conjunction with security keys, ordinary users can easily achieve the same level of data security as e-commerce.
      Vault Manager is primarily used in the following three application scenarios:
      1. Provides large-capacity hardware-encrypted vault files for local personal use. Security key hardware is required to access vault data. Users can create local personal-use hardware-encrypted secure storage container files;
      2. Provides medium-capacity public key encrypted vault files for cloud storage. Security key hardware is required to access vault data. Users can securely store important data on the internet without worrying about leaks;
      3. Provides small-capacity public key encrypted vault files for remote transmission, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of important data during transmission. Users can securely send important data to their remote endpoints over the internet.

2. User Responsibilities and Risk Assumption
      Users agree to purchase the vault certificate for personal or internal company use only. They must not engage in illegal or unauthorized activities, including but not limited to identity fraud, illegal transmission of state secrets and classified documents, transmission of politically sensitive files, or transmission of unauthorized infringing content.
      Users must not reverse-engineer, crack, tamper with, or otherwise damage the Vault Manager software.
      If a security incident occurs due to user negligence, such as failing to change the default security key password, using a weak password, or having their security key stolen, the user bears full responsibility for any resulting consequences and liabilities.
      Users should carefully read the Vault Manager software documentation, familiarize themselves with the operational procedures, and maintain good habits of regular data backups. It is recommended to prepare a second security key as a backup to significantly reduce the risk of data loss or corruption.

3. Developer and Operator Responsibilities

4. Privacy and Data Security
      The vault certificate is for the purchaser's exclusive use for public key encryption vault files and must not be lent to others. The holder and contact information in the vault certificate are user-defined for their own identification purposes.
      The Vault Manager developer and operator do not verify the authenticity of any vault certificate information. They are not responsible for any consequences arising from misplaced trust in such information.
      The Vault Manager software does not collect, use, or store any user data during its use. Users can use it with confidence.
