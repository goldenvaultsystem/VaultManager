                                          Vault Manager Help Document

1. Purpose of Vault Manager
    The Vault Manager software uses bank security key technology to protect your important data. Encrypted VHD files are a native Windows solution for secure data storage. Vault Manager simplifies the process of using Windows' native BitLocker encryption for VHD files by providing tools to create vault files, manage vault usage, and handle hardware keys. It enhances security with smart card touch confirmation, effectively preventing brute-force attacks and ensuring robust data protection.

    The vault VHD file generated by Vault Manager is natively supported by Windows and can be opened directly in any Windows environment without using Vault Manager.

    Vault Manager is primarily used in the following three application scenarios:
    1. Provides large-capacity vault files for local personal use, requiring a security key to open. Users can create secure storage containers for personal use;
    2. Provides medium-capacity vault files for secure cloud storage, requiring a security key to open. Users can store important data online without leakage concerns;
    3. Provides small-capacity vault files for secure remote transmission, requiring a security key to open. Users can transmit sensitive data securely to remote endpoints.

2.  Vault Manager and Hardware Key Security
    Vault Manager's Dual Protection:
    1. Vault files are created with a license, only the licensed key can open the file;
    2. For cloud and remote files, smart card protection is recommended. For locally stored large-capacity vault files, we recommend using smart card authentication with password protection, where the password serves as a backup recovery method for local emergency access.

    The security key storing the license provides four private key protections:
    1. The license is written once and cannot be read, eliminating theft risks;
    2. Using the key requires PIN entry and physical touch confirmation to prevent automated brute-force attacks;
    3. Three incorrect PIN attempts lock the key. Three incorrect PUK attempts will permanently disable both PUK and reset security key PIN functions, requiring hardware key initialization. This process restores factory defaults and irrevocably erases all license data;
    4. The license in the key is non-clonable and non-recoverable. Without a backup key, previous vaults cannot be opened.

3. Vault Manager System Requirements
    Operating System: Supports all versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 in both Simplified Chinese and English languages (the Home edition does not support creating new vault files).
    Administrator Privileges: The software must be run with administrator rights. Standard users can obtain administrator privileges by being added to the Administrators group.
    Other Required Software: yubico-piv-tool. Users must download and install yubico-piv-tool from Yubico's official website: https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/Releases/.

4. Vault Manager Usage Process
    **For Individual Users:**
    1. Purchase and prepare a security key in advance. Supported hardware includes Canokey and Yubikey.
    2. Use either the trial license automatically generated in the user's home directory during Vault Manager installation, or obtain a paid commercial license from the Vault Manager developer.
    3. Use Vault Manager to write the license into the security key.
    4. Use Vault Manager and the security key to create personal vault files and store important data inside them.
    5. Depending on the usage purpose, store the vault file locally, in the cloud, or transmit it securely to a remote endpoint.
    6. To access vault files, use Vault Manager and the security key. Enter the security key PIN and physically touch the key to open and access the encrypted data.

    **For Enterprise Users:**
    1. The company must purchase security key hardware in advance (Canokey and Yubikey are supported).
    2. The company contacts the Vault Manager developer and operator for customized development, internal self-licensing center certificates, and internal licensing issuance tools.
    3. The company uses the internal licensing issuance tool to generate licenses for specific employees, writes them to the security key, and then distributes them to designated users.
    4. Company users use Vault Manager and the security key to create vault files and store important data.
    5. Depending on the usage purpose, store the vault file locally, in the cloud, or transmit it securely to a remote endpoint.
    6. To access vault files, use Vault Manager and the security key. Enter the security key PIN and physically touch the key to open and access the encrypted data.

5. Vault Manager Versions and Features
    Vault Manager has two versions: China Version and Non-China Global Version.
    
    Non-China Global Version: Features a bilingual (Chinese/English) user interface, available only for individual users outside of China. 

    **China Version**: Features a bilingual (Chinese/English) user interface, available for individual users and company clients in China, supporting secondary customized development for internal enterprise use.

    Its usage is subject to export control and encryption regulations in different countries. Users must ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. If local laws prohibit the use of this software, or the user violates regional restrictions, the license will be immediately revoked, and the user will bear all resulting legal responsibilities.

    Important: Administrator privileges are required when using Vault Manager functions. If the current user is not an administrator, they must provide an administrator account and password to run the application. If the current user is added to the system administrator group, they will no longer need to enter the administrator account and password in the future.

1). Create Personal Vault File Function
    Encrypt vault files using the license in the user's security key. These files can only be decrypted and opened using the same security key. Users can create large-capacity, hardware-encrypted secure files for personal local use, medium-capacity secure files for cloud storage, or small-capacity secure files for secure internet transmission to their remote endpoint. Windows 10 and Windows 11 Home editions do not support the creation of new vault files, but other versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 do.

2). Load/Unload Vault File Function
    The load/unload vault file function is used to decrypt and access vault files. When a vault file is double-clicked, if it has not been loaded before, Vault Manager will load it as a system virtual disk, allowing users to decrypt and access critical data using their security key. If the file has already been loaded, Vault Manager will unload and close the corresponding system virtual disk.

3). Write license to Security Key Function
    In the license writing interface, the selected license is written into the selected security key slot. Once updated, the user can use the new license.

4). Self-Licensing Center Management Function (Available in China Version Only)
    If the user's security key is issued and authorized by the company's internal self-licensing center, they must add the company's internal self-licensing center certificate to Vault Manager. Otherwise, the license stored in the security key will not be recognized or read by Vault Manager.

5). View Security Key license Function
    In the license Manager, users can view a summary of the selected security key's license, including the license ID, expiration date, vault ID and vault holder. The holder information in the license are user-defined for personal identification purposes. Vault Manager developers and operators do not authenticate the accuracy of any license information and are not responsible for it.

6). Change Security Key PIN Function
    To change the security key PIN, users must enter the old PIN and then input the new PIN twice. Three consecutive incorrect PIN attempts will lock the security key and make it unusable.

7). Change Security Key PUK Function
    To change the security key PUK, users must enter the old PUK and then input the new PUK twice. Three consecutive incorrect PUK attempts will lock the PUK and reset security key PIN functions, making it unusable. The user must manually reset the security key, which will restore it to factory settings and erase all stored data.

8). Reset Security Key PIN Function
    Users can directly set a new security key PIN by entering the PUK and inputting the new PIN twice. Three consecutive incorrect PUK attempts will lock the PUK and reset security key PIN functions, making it unusable. The user must manually reset the security key, which will restore it to factory settings and erase all stored data.

6. Security Key Management and Storage
    Users are fully responsible for managing and storing their security keys, including loss, damage, or theft.
    Private keys should not be stored on internet-connected devices. Instead, they should be securely stored offline, such as on a fully offline USB device kept in a safe, only accessed when updating the key.
    Users should not lend their security keys to others. It is recommended to change the default PIN PUK codes and management key immediately, set a strong password, and avoid exposing the password in public places.
    Three consecutive incorrect PIN attempts will lock the security key. Users can reset the PIN within Vault Manager.
    **Important**: If the user enters the wrong PUK code three times during change security key PUK or reset security key PIN operation, will lock the PUK and reset security key PIN functions, making it unusable. The user must manually reset the security key, which will restore it to factory settings and erase all stored data.

    Emergency Handling for Lost or Stolen Security Key:
    Users should stop using previous vault files and use a backup security key to transfer important data from the vault file to a secure location. The backup security key should no longer be used to create new vault files.
    Users should contact the Vault Manager developer and operator to update the security key and obtain a new license. The new license should be written into the security key. Once the update is complete, users can use the new license.

7. Privacy and Data Security
    licenses are for the purchaser's personal use only and must not be lent to others. The holder information in the license are user-defined for self-identification purposes. The trial license is for testing purposes only. Vault files created with trial licenses must not store sensitive data, as this may lead to data breaches.
    The Vault Manager developer and operator do not authenticate the accuracy of license information and are not responsible for any consequences arising from misinterpretation.
    Vault Manager software does not collect, use, or store user data. Users can use it with confidence.
